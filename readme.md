# Gon(e) Tools
This utility provides multiple tools.

All components must be configured in the `config.ini` file. Please take a look at the documentation in the file.

## Components
### Switch to SSH
This utility goes through all folders in the current directory and expects that each directory is a GIT repository. It checks for each if the origin is set to `gitlab_url` SSH. If it is set to HTTPS it changes it to SSH.
